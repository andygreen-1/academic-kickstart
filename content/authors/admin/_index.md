Andy Green is a graduate student in the Data Science for Public Policy program (MS-DSPP) at Georgetown University. Since arriving at Georgetown, he has worked in data science and research roles at the Census Bureau, the Massive Data Institute, and the Center for Retirement Initiatives. Additionally, he writes, edits, and develops data visualizations for the Georgetown Public Policy Review, currently serving as a leader of the Data Viz editing team.

Prior to starting graduate school, Andy spent five years in the retail industry. Most recently, he helped lead the international launch of Lidl's US operations, as a manager on the Promotions team. In that role, he analyzed the grocery market in depth, crafted a differentiated promotional strategy from scratch, established his team's cross-functional processes, and led a team of direct reports through Lidl's initial launch and first two years of operations.
