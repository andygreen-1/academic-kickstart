Subject: Recommendation to Tighten Regulations on E-cigarettes, Focused on Teen Smoking Epidemic

Recommendation:
The Administration should move aggressively to combat the growing epidemic of teen smoking.  I recommend that the FDA institute a ban on flavored E-cigarettes, further regulate the advertising and marketing activities of E-cigarette companies, and escalate enforcement measures on underage sales of E-cigarettes. Additionally, the Administration should voice support for ongoing legislative efforts to raise the legal age of purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21 years old.  Undertaking these measures would have a major impact on combating the epidemic of teen smoking, while not infringing on the liberty of adults,  or negating the potential public health benefits of existing smokers switching to E-cigarettes.
