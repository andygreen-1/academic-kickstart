In this report, we evaluate the coverage and cost effects of extending the American Rescue Plan's enhanced premium subsidies in Massachusetts in 2023. We find that the subsidies would have the following effects:

- 8,000 additional people would gain coverage.
- The state government would save $133 million.
- Average spending on premiums would fall by $199 for the year among those enrolled in subsidized coverage through the Health Connector. 

The [report](https://www.bluecrossmafoundation.org/publication/expanded-coverage-and-savings-effects-massachusetts-extending-american-rescue-plan-acts) was published by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation in March 2022.
