The following is a series of interactive dashboards exploring how each state has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how that may be related to the volume of cases and deaths experienced by that state. In addition to the state-level data, I also aggregate the data by the political party of a state's governor, reflecting the average of all states with Democratic and Republican governors, respectively.

These dashboards, along with a short accompanying piece, were published by the Georgetown Public Policy Review in August 2020. The link to that publication can be found [here](http://gppreview.com/2020/08/20/visualizing-covid-19-policy-responses-outcomes-state-party/).

The data and code used in this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/andygreen-1/COVID-19_policy_responses).
