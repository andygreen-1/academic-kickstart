The following is a series of interactive dashboards exploring which states are experiencing the most severe economic fallout from COVID-19, and how that tracks with the states hit hardest by the virus itself.

These dashboards, along with a short accompanying piece, were published by the Georgetown Public Policy Review in April 2020. The link to that publication can be found [here](http://gppreview.com/2020/04/23/covid-19-cases-unemployment-claims-state/).

The data and code used in this analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/andygreen-1/COVID-19_unemployment).
