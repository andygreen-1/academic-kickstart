This brief examines the coverage and cost effects of two health insurance reforms being considered by Congress. Some of the highlights of the brief include:

- Making ARPA premium subsidies permanent and filling the Medicaid coverage gap would reduce the number of people without insurance by nearly one-quarter, or 7.0 million people, in 2022.
- All states would see a drop in their uninsured population, with the largest percentage declines in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid eligibility.
- Enrollment in subsidized marketplace plans would nearly double, while premiums would fall by 18 percent on average.
- Federal spending would increase by an estimated `$`442 billion over 10 years and, after accounting for increased revenues because of higher wages and some offsetting savings, this reform would increase the federal deficit by an estimated `$`333 billion if no other changes in policy were made.

The brief was published by the Commonwealth Fund in September 2021. The link to that publication can be found [here](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/sep/coverage-cost-effects-key-health-insurance-reforms-congress).
