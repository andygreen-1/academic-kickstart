Mission-driven data scientist with a passion for using data to improve how government designs policies, delivers services, and protects consumers. I have over a decade of experience across government, think tanks, academia, and the private sector, including over four years of experience leading teams. Some of my work experiences include:

- Assessing algorithmic fairness and developing less discriminatory credit scoring models at the CFPB
- Projecting the coverage and cost effects of health insurance reform policies at the Urban Institute
- Leading teams of data scientists and analysts delivering effective outreach and seamless experiences for federal health programs at Inroads/BlueLabs
- Collecting, processing, and analyzing text data to develop measures of political ideology at the Massive Data Institute
