**Summary:**

This piece explores issues related to algorithmic fairness in lending, focused on a simple question with a not-so-simple answer: how should we measure fairness? It explores different approaches to measuring fairness, discusses the thorny normative questions that underpin this question, and offers some considerations for lenders and regulators when designing disparate impact testing processes.
