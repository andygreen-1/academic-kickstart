The Biden Administration Policy Tracking Project aims to record, summarize, and visualize policy actions taken by the Biden administration. This includes actions like releasing a new policy proposal, issuing executive orders, and working with Congress to pass legislation.

In addition to viewing the visualizations below, you can find a landing page for the project [here](https://andygreen-1.github.io/Biden_Administration_Policy_Actions/). The landing page contains the same three visualizations, as well as a discussion of the data collection process and some use cases for the dataset.
