**Summary:**

This brief examines the coverage and cost effects of two health insurance reforms being considered by Congress. Some of the highlights of the brief include:

- Making ARPA premium subsidies permanent and filling the Medicaid coverage gap would reduce the number of people without insurance by nearly one-quarter, or 7.0 million people, in 2022.
- All states would see a drop in their uninsured population, with the largest percentage declines in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid eligibility.
- Enrollment in subsidized marketplace plans would nearly double, while premiums would fall by 18 percent on average.
- Federal spending would increase by an estimated \$442 billion over 10 years and, after accounting for increased revenues because of higher wages and some offsetting savings, this reform would increase the federal deficit by an estimated \$333 billion if no other changes in policy were made.
